This is a [dual CJS2/ES module][dual-module] package. That means this package
exposes both CJS2 and ESM entry points.

Loading this package via `require(...)` will cause Node and Webpack to use the
[CJS2 bundle][cjs2] entry point, disable [tree shaking][tree-shaking] in Webpack
4, and lead to larger bundles in Webpack 5. Alternatively, loading this package
via `import { ... } from ...` or `import(...)` will cause Node to use the ESM
entry point in [versions that support it][node-esm-support], as will Webpack.
Using the `import` syntax is the modern, preferred choice.

For backwards compatibility with Webpack 4 (_compat with Webpack 4 is not
guaranteed!_) and Node versions < 14, [`package.json`][package-json] retains the
[`module`][module-key] key, which points to the ESM entry point, and the
[`main`][exports-main-key] key, which points to the CJS2 entry point explicitly
(using the .js file extension). For Webpack 5 and Node versions >= 14,
[`package.json`][package-json] includes the [`exports`][exports-main-key] key,
which points to both entry points explicitly.

Though [`package.json`][package-json] includes
[`{ "type": "commonjs"}`][local-pkg], note that the ESM entry points are ES
module (`.mjs`) files. [`package.json`][package-json] also includes the
[`sideEffects`][side-effects-key] key, which is `false` for [optimal tree
shaking][tree-shaking], and the `types` key, which points to a TypeScript
declarations file.

Additionally, this package does not maintain shared state and so does not
exhibit the [dual package hazard][hazard]. However, setting global configuration
may not actually be "globally" recognized by third-party code importing this
package.
