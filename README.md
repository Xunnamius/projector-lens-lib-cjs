This is a [dual UMD (CJS2)/ES module][dual-module] package. That means this
package exposes both UMD+CJS2 and ESM entry points and can be used in most
JavaScript environments (browsers, any current or LTS Node version, etc).

Loading this package via `require(...)` will cause Node and modern browsers to
use the [CJS2 bundle][cjs2] entry point, disable [tree shaking][tree-shaking] in
Webpack 4, and lead to larger bundles in Webpack 5. Alternatively, loading this
package via `import { ... } from ...` or `import(...)` will cause Node and
modern browsers to use the ESM entry point in [versions that support
it][node-esm-support], in Webpack, and in the browser. Using the `import` syntax
is the modern, preferred choice.

For backwards compatibility with Webpack 4 and Node versions < 14,
[`package.json`][18] retains the [`module`][module-key] key, which points to the
ESM entry point, and the [`main`][exports-main-key] key, which points to both
the ESM and CJS2 entry points implicitly (no file extension). For Webpack 5 and
Node versions >= 14, [`package.json`][18] includes the
[`exports`][exports-main-key] key, which points to both entry points explicitly.

Though [`package.json`][18] includes [`{ "type": "commonjs"}`][local-pkg], note
that the ESM entry points are ES module (`.mjs`) files. [`package.json`][18]
also includes the [`sideEffects`][side-effects-key] key, which is `false` for
[optimal tree shaking][tree-shaking], and the `types` key, which points to a
TypeScript declarations file.

Additionally, this package does not maintain shared state and so does not
exhibit the [dual package hazard][hazard]. However, setting global configuration
may not actually be "globally" recognized by third-party code importing this
package.
