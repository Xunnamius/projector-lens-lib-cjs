## Reporting an Issue

Before you begin, please [search open
issues](https://github.com/Xunnamius/workflow-playground/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=)
to see if your issue or feature request is already being talked about.

If you find your issue already exists, make sure to [bump the issue by adding a
reaction](https://github.com/blog/2119-add-reactions-to-pull-requests-issues-and-comments).
**If you're serious about wanting an issue to get attention, use a reaction in
place of a "+1" or other spam comment.**

If you cannot find an existing issue that describes your bug or feature, then
you're clear to create your issue using the guidelines below.

:+1: 👍🏿👍🏾👍🏽👍🏼👍🏻👍 — up vote (also: *approve*, *like*, *+1*)

:-1: 👎🏿👎🏾👎🏽👎🏼👎🏻👎 — down vote (also: *disapprove*, *dislike*, *-1*)

### Bug Reports and Feature Requests

[follow the
template](https://github.com/Xunnamius/workflow-playground/issues/new?template=bug_report.md).
The more quality information you can provide, the quicker a fix will be found.
Additionally:

* Ensure you file one issue per problem or feature request
* Do not enumerate multiple bugs or feature requests in the same issue
* Do not add your issue as a comment to an existing issue unless you're
  experiencing identical behavior or behavior that stems from the exact same
  issue

That's it! You are now ready to [fearlessly submit your new
issue](https://github.com/Xunnamius/workflow-playground/issues/new/choose)!
Thank you for contribution 🎉, your efforts are greatly appreciated! 🙌🏿
